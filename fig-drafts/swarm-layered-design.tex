demonstrate in a very simple way the 4 layers of swarm, as described in : 

conceive of Swarm as having clearly separable layers (see figure ), each dependent on the previous one: (1) a peer-to-peer network protocol to serve as underlay transport, (2) an overlay network with protocols powering a distributed immutable storage of chunk (fix-sized data blocks), (3) a component for higher-level data access defining APIs for the base-layer features, and (4) an application layer potentially defining the standards, capturing best practices for more elaborate use-cases. We regard (2) and (3) as the core of Swarm.
