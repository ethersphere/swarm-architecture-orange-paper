Let's  index  the epochs with negative integers with an ordering respecting recency, i.e., the current epoch is 0, the most recent $-1$, the previous one $-2$, etc. 
Let $n$ be the cutoff memory size for past epochs.
Let $\mathit{Hits}(e)$ denote the number of hits a chunk is served during epoch $e$. 

Let's build a popularity predictive model based on past observations using the assumption of exponential decay with time in predictive power. 

\begin{equation}
    \mathit{Hits}(0) \defeq \frac{\sum_{e=0}^n \frac{\mathit{Hits}(e)}{c^e}}{c^{n-1}}
\end{equation}
