\section{Structure}\label{spec:conventions}

\ref{spec:convention} enlists all the conventions relating data types, formats and processes.
The specifications are given under four headings. Protocols 
(\ref{spec:protocol}) specify wire protocols: message formats and serialisation and encapsulation are hard requirements that is crucial for  cross client compatibility.
Strategies (\ref{spec:strategy} are meant to be recommended  behaviour that is supposed to be aligned with economic incentives.
Strategies may not be optimal, in some cases, the directions focused on simplicity and ease of reasoning.
APIs (\ref{spec:api}) gives a formal specification of the high level interfaces of Swarm. Different client implementations are going to be tested against a standard suite of API tests.
